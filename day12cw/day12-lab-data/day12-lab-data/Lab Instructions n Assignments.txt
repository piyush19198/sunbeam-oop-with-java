3. Go through simple code samples from day1-data\code\src

4. Solve 
4.1 Accept 2 double values from User (using Scanner). Check data type.
. If arguments are not doubles , supply suitable error message & terminate.
If numbers are double values , print its average.
eg : 
Scanner sc=new Scanner(....);
sop("Enter 2 double nos");// 123 abc
if(sc.hasNextDouble())
{
//=> 1st no is of the type double
   double d1=sc.nextDouble();
   if(....)
   {
   } else 
     sop("1st no is invalid");
} else
 sop("1st no invalid");



4.2 Display food menu to user. User will select items from menu along with the quantity. (eg 1. Dosa 2. Samosa 3. Idli ... 10 . Generate Bill ) Assign fixed prices to food items(hard code the prices)
When user enters 'Generate Bill' option(10) , display total bill & exit.
eg : boolean exit=false;
double totalBill=0.0;

while(!exit)
{
   sop("options....");
   sop("choose");
   switch(sc.nextInt())
  {
    case 1: sop("Enter qty");
    totalBill += (60*sc.nextInt());
    break;
   .....
    case 10 : sop("total bill"+....);
    exit=true;
    break;
  }
}

Modify box class , to supply following functionality & test it using a separate class TestBoxFunctionality.java

4.1 Create Cube
TestBoxFunctionality.java
User will supply side of the cube. Create a cube from it.
Hint : Add overloaded constructor in Box class : single argument 

4.2. Add a method to Box class to compare equality of 2 boxes & test it.
Hint : 2 boxes are equal if & only if , their dimensions are exactly the same.
eg : box1 : 10 20 30
box2 : 20 10 30
What should be method declaration in Box class ?
boolean isEqual(Box anotherBox)
{
 ......
}
From Tester class 
box1 , box2
How to invoke the method ?
box1.isEqual(box2)


4.3 Add a method to Box class to return a new Box with modified offset in dimensions & test it with the tester.
eg : Suppose client has ordered 1st Box : 10 20 30
Clnt orders another new box : with ref to 1st box : 3 -4 -2
App should create another NEW BOX :13 16 28
eg : Box box1=new Box(sc.nextDouble(),sc.nextDouble(),sc.nextDouble());
sop("Enter the offsets w.r.t 1st box: width offset d offset h offset");
Box box2=box1.createNewBox(....);


4.4 Display color of the box , having larger volume.
Hint : add color as state + add getter

Day 3

2. Display x, y co-ordinates of all points
Hint : for-each

3. User i/p : 2 indices for the points , validate the indices
Display distance between specified points (iff they are not located at the same position)
eg : sop("Enter index of strt point n end point");
validation : boundary condition (0<=index<length-1)
isEqual -- false --compute distance --display it.
4. Exit

4.1 Emp state--- id(int), name, deptId(string) , basic(double)
Emp id should NOT be accepted from user. It should be auto generated , in auto increment manner
Hint : add static data member : idGenerator
Inc it n assign it to emp id : in emp class ctor.

Get emp details -- using overriding form of toString

4.2 Mgr state  ---id,name,basic,deptId , performanceBonus

Behaviour ----1. get mgr details : via toString
2. compute net salary (formula: basic+perfmonceBonus) 
3. get performance bonus. 

4.3 Worker state  --id,name,basic,deptId,hoursWorked,hourlyRate
Behaviour--- 
1. get worker details -- via toString
2.  compute net salary (formula:  = basic+(hoursWorked*hourlyRate) 
3. get hrlyRate of the worker  -- add a new method to return hourly rate of a worker.(getter)

Can you organize these classes in inheritance  hierarchy?

4.4 Write TestOrganization in "tester" package.
Create suitable array to store organization details.

Provide following options. Run the application till "exit"

1. Hire Manager

2. Hire Worker  

3. Display information of all employees , including net salary using single for-each loop.
Display from the same for-each loop, performance bonus if it's a manager or if it's a worker , display hourly rate of the worker .

4. Update basic salary
i/p : emp id &  increment in basic component of salary
o/p : In case of invalid emp id , give suitable error message. Otherwise , increment the salary.

5.  Exit

Day7 
No New assignments!
If you want , 
1. Can add abstraction in Fruits scenarion

1.3 Create implementation class of Stack i/f -- FixedStack (array based)
1.4 Create another implementation class of Stack i/f-- GrowableStack (array based)
1.5

Create Tester class (Hint :  use dynamic method dispatch using interfaces)
Display Menu
Note : Must use 1 switch-case only. You won't need any complex nested control structure
Once user selects either fixed or growable stack , user shouldn't be allowed to change the selection of the stack.
(Hint : null checking)

1 -- Choose Fixed Stack
2 -- Choose Growable Stack
Accept following options only after initial selection.(Hint : null checking)
3 -- Push data 
I/P : Accept emp details & store these details in the earlier chosen stack or give error mesg : NO stack chosen !!!

Solve Vehicle equality assignment
Problem :
Create a class Vehicle , under the package : com.app.vehicles , to represent any vehicle. 
Supply tight encapsulation
state(data members)  : chasisNo : int , color : String , price : double
chasisNo  MUST be unique (non duplicate) for any vehicle (primary Key : unique ID)
Get  complete state : toString
Hint : override equals method inherited from Object class : to replace ref equality by content equality(based upon unique ID : PK)

Create a class TestVehicle under the package "tester"
Accept details of 2 vehicles from user . 
Display "SAME" or "DIFFERENT" , in case of same or different chasis nos.
Hint : invoke equals

7. Objective : Use exception handling , string handling & Date in vehicle showroom based scenario
Vehicle's  state(attributes) --chasisNo : String , color : String ,category:string, price : double , manufactureDate(Date)
Add validation rules for the inputs : 
chasisNo id unique
category  : Petrol , Diesel, EV , Hybrid , CNG
manufactureDate : in this financial year (1st Apr 2021 to 31Mar 2022) 

Create a tester as Showroom.
Options

Apply all validation rules . In case of success , add the vehicle in the showroom
Otherwise raise custom exception , alert user using exc handling.

2. Display All Vehicles

3. Exit


Day 10 
1. Complete pending work.

2. Revise class work.
2.1 import day10.1 to understand working of "equals" completely.

Modify chasisNo based unique id to : chasisNo & color.(equivalent to composite PK)
Meaning : Treat 2 vehicles same iff chasisNo n color is same.
Test it , using all test cases.

2.2 It will be better to directly import day10.3 .
Revise Date Time parsing , formatting, validation rules n enum
Make changes
Modify type of color from String to Enum
Make necessary changes n test.

2.3 Instead of giving this error message : "No Enum constant" , can you supply a better message?
Invalid Category Chosen!!!!
Valid Categories are : petrol , diesel ...

Similary do it for Color.
